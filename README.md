**NOTE:** This plugin does not currently support dynamic tracking (the tracking of multiple pageviews on a single page). Some common use-cases for dynamic tracking are slideshows or articles loaded via AJAX calls in single-page applications -- situations in which new content is loaded without a full page refresh. Tracking these events requires manually implementing additional JavaScript above [the standard Parse.ly include](http://www.parsely.com/help/integration/basic/) that the plugin injects into your page source. Please consult [the Parse.ly documentation on dynamic tracking](https://www.parsely.com/help/integration/dynamic/) for instructions on implementing dynamic tracking, or contact Parse.ly support for additional assistance.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Where do I find my Site ID? ###

Your Site ID is your own site domain name (e.g., `mysite.com`).

### Why can't I see Dash code on my post when I preview? ###

Dash code will only be placed on pages and posts which have been published in WordPress to ensure we don't track traffic generated while you're still writing a post/page.

### How can I edit the values passed to the JSON-LD metadata? ###

You can use the `after_set_parsely_page` filter, which sends three arguments: the array of metadata, the post object, and the `parselyOptions` array:

```
$parselyPage = apply_filters('after_set_parsely_page', $parselyPage, $post, $parselyOptions);
```

This filter can go anywhere in your codebase, provided it always gets loaded. We recommend putting it in your header file, so that it gets loaded with wp_head.

### Is the plugin Google AMP/Facebook Instant ready?

It is! We are hooked into Automattic's official plugins for AMP and Facebook Instant. AMP support is enabled automatically if the Automattic AMP plugin is installed, and for Facebook Instant you just have to enable "Parsely Analytics" in the "Advanced Settings" menu of the Facebook Instant Articles plugin.

Official AMP plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/  
Official FB Instant plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/fb-instant-articles/

### How do I create a local dev environment to make changes to the `wp-parsely` code? ###

See [the wiki](https://github.com/Parsely/wp-parsely/wiki/Setting-up-a-WP-plugin-development-environment).
