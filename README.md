### Features

The wp-parsely plugin is packed with features that allow for a seamless integration process, and brings the power of the Parse.ly dashboard into WordPress.

#### Automated integration

The plugin automatically inserts the Parse.ly metadata and JavaScript in all published pages and posts (Custom Post Types are supported). It also provides a settings page to customize your integration, with options including:
- Output Parse.ly metadata as [JSON-LD](https://docs.parse.ly/metadata-jsonld/) or [repeated meta tags](https://docs.parse.ly/metatags/).
- Choose whether logged-in users should be tracked.
- Define how to track every Post Type (as Post, Non-Post or no tracking).

#### The Parse.ly Content Helper

The [Content Helper](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-content-helper/) is a set of content insight tools including:
- The [Parse.ly Dashboard Widget](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-content-helper/#h-dashboard) - Displays the site's top posts in the WordPress Dashboard.
- The [Parse.ly Stats Column](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-content-helper/#h-posts) - Displays published post performance for the last 7 days in Post Lists.
- The [Parse.ly Editor Sidebar](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-content-helper/#h-editor) - This sidebar is integrated into the WordPress Editor and offers insights about the content currently being edited such as:
  - [Performance Details](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-content-helper/#h-performance-details) - Displays performance metrics about the content currently being edited.
  - [Related Top Posts](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-content-helper/#h-related-top-posts) - Displays a list of the websiteâ€™s most successful posts, similar to the post/page currently being edited.
  - [Title Suggestions](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-content-helper/#h-title-suggestions-beta) - Generates title suggestions for the post/page currently being edited.
- The [Parse.ly Excerpt Generator](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-content-helper/#h-excerpt-generator-beta) - A Post Editor settings enhancement that generates an excerpt for the post/page currently being edited.

#### The Parse.ly Recommendations Block

The plugin includes a [Recommendations Block](https://docs.parse.ly/recommendations-block/) that displays a list of posts related to the currently viewed post/page. The Block is useful for showcasing related content to visitors, and it can also be used in Site Editing mode or as a [Block-based Widget](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-based-widgets-editor/). 

#### Advanced integrations support

While the plugin works out of the box for basic integrations, it offers a host of features that easily allow for advanced integration scenarios:
- Support for [Google Tag Manager, AMP, Google Web Stories and Cloudflare](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-common-questions/#h-is-wp-parsely-compatible-with-amp-facebook-instant-articles-or-google-web-stories) is included.
- The plugin exposes the `wpParselyOnLoad` and `wpParselyOnReady` JavaScript hooks that allow for advanced integrations requiring JavaScript, such as [Dynamic Tracking](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-dynamic-tracking/).
- Support for WordPress [network/multisite](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-common-questions/#h-is-wp-parsely-compatible-with-wordpress-network-multisite) and [decoupled/headless](https://docs.parse.ly/plugin-decoupled-headless-support/) (GraphQL and WP Rest API) setups is included.
- Last but not least, a wide range of hooks is available in order to customize the plugin's functionality even further.
